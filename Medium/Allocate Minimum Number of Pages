Problem Statement: Given an array ‘arr of integer numbers, ‘ar[i]’ represents the number of pages in the ‘i-th’ book. There are a ‘m’ number of students, and the task is to allocate all the books to the students.
Allocate books in such a way that:

Each student gets at least one book.
Each book should be allocated to only one student.
Book allocation should be in a contiguous manner.
You have to allocate the book to ‘m’ students such that the maximum number of pages assigned to a student is minimum. If the allocation of books is not possible. return -1



Example 1:
Input Format:
 n = 4, m = 2, arr[] = {12, 34, 67, 90}
Result:
 113
Explanation:
 The allocation of books will be 12, 34, 67 | 90. One student will get the first 3 books and the other will get the last one.
