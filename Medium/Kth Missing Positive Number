Given an array arr of positive integers sorted in a strictly increasing order, and an integer k.
Return the kth positive integer that is missing from this array.

Example 1:

Input: arr = [2,3,4,7,11], k = 5
Output: 9
Explanation: The missing positive integers are [1,5,6,8,9,10,12,13,...]. The 5th missing positive integer is 9.
