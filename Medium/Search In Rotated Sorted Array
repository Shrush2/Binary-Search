Aahad and Harshit always have fun by solving problems. Harshit took a sorted array consisting of distinct integers and rotated it clockwise by an unknown amount.
For example, he took a sorted array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and if he rotates it by 2, then the array becomes: [4, 5, 1, 2, 3].
After rotating a sorted array, Aahad needs to answer Q queries asked by Harshit, each of them is described by one integer Q[i]. which Harshit wanted him 
to search in the array. For each query, if he found it, he had to shout the index of the number, otherwise, he had to shout -1.

For each query, you have to complete the given method where 'key' denotes Q[i]. If the key exists in the array, return the index of the 'key', otherwise, return -1.


T.C => O(log N)
S.C => O(1)



Example
arr = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
key = 0

1️⃣ Iteration 1
low = 0, high = 6
mid = 3 → arr[mid] = 7


Left half sorted (4 ≤ 7)

Key NOT in [4,7]
➡️ Move right

low = 4

2️⃣ Iteration 2
low = 4, high = 6
mid = 5 → arr[mid] = 1


Left half sorted (0 ≤ 1)

Key IS in [0,1]
➡️ Move left

high = 4

3️⃣ Iteration 3
low = 4, high = 4
mid = 4 → arr[mid] = 0


✅ Key found

Answer = 4
