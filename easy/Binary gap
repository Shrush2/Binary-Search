It is a day of celebration here at Coding Ninjas because our beloved Ninja Hu-chan is going to get his JatSu belt (the highest belt a ninja can get).
He is just one step away from making his dream come true, but hold the line, Hu-chan’s master knows all his weaknesses and is going to do a final test 
of his skills before he is announced as the greatest ninja ever.

Master is aware of Ninja Hu-chan’s rivalry with maths and therefore he gives him a mathematical problem to solve, being a good friend and well-wisher of our Ninja,
can you help him solve the problem assigned and thus acclaim the title of the greatest ninja?

The problem read as follows:
You are given a number ‘NUM’, return the maximum distance between any two adjacent 1s in the binary representation of 'NUM'.
Note:
The two 1s are called adjacent if there isn’t another 1 between them. The distance between 2 bits is the absolute difference between their bit positions.

Time Complexity = O(log₂(NUM))
Space Complexity = O(1)
