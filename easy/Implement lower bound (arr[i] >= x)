ou are given an array 'arr' sorted in non-decreasing order and a number 'x'. You must return the index of the lower bound of 'x'.
Note:
1. For a sorted array 'arr', 'lower_bound' of a number 'x' is defined as the smallest index 'idx' such that the value 'arr[idx]' is not less than 'x'.
If all numbers are smaller than 'x', then 'n' should be the 'lower_bound' of 'x', where 'n' is the size of array.

2. Try to do this in O(log(n)).
